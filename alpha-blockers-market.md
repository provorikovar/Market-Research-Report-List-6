<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alpha Blockers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-selective Antagonists</li><li>Selective Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Alpha blockers are categorized into two main market types: non-selective antagonists and selective antagonists. Non-selective antagonists, such as phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine, block both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, leading to broader effects on vascular tone and blood pressure. In contrast, selective antagonists primarily target alpha-1 receptors, like prazosin and terazosin, providing a more targeted approach, often used for hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. This differentiation allows for tailored treatment options based on patient needs and specific medical conditions.</p></p>
