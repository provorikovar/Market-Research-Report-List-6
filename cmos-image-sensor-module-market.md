<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS Image Sensor Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Backside-illuminated (BSI)</li><li>BSI Stacked</li><li>Front-illuminated (FI)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CMOS Image Sensor Module market is categorized into three primary types: Backside-Illuminated (BSI), BSI Stacked, and Front-Illuminated (FI) sensors. BSI sensors enhance light capture by placing the photodiode in front of the circuitry, improving low-light performance. BSI Stacked sensors take this further by stacking layers, allowing for even more efficient light gathering and additional functionalities. Conversely, Front-Illuminated sensors, although older technology, remain in use for their simpler manufacturing processes but typically offer lower performance in low-light conditions.</p></p>
