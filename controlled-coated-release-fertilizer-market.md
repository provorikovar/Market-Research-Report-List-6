<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Controlled (Coated) Release Fertilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer-Coated Products</li><li>Non Polymer-Coated Products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Controlled (Coated) Release Fertilizer market is categorized into two main types: Polymer-Coated Products and Non-Polymer-Coated Products. Polymer-Coated Products feature a polymer layer that regulates nutrient release, providing a sustained supply to plants over extended periods. This type minimizes leaching and enhances nutrient availability. In contrast, Non-Polymer-Coated Products utilize other coatings or materials to control release, typically offering less duration and efficiency. Both types aim to improve fertilization efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and enhance crop yields.</p></p>
