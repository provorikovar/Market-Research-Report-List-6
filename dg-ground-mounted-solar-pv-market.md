<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DG Ground-mounted Solar PV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crystalline Silicon</li><li>Thin Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>DG ground-mounted solar PV systems can be categorized into two main types: crystalline silicon and thin film. Crystalline silicon modules are made from silicon wafers and are the most commonly used technology in the market due to their higher efficiency. Thin film modules, on the other hand, are made by depositing a thin layer of semiconductor material onto a substrate. They are typically less efficient but are more flexible and lightweight, making them suitable for certain applications where weight and flexibility are key considerations.</p></p>
