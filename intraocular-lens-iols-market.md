<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraocular Lens (IOLs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-foldable lenses</li><li>Foldable Intraocular Lens</li><li>Hydrophilic</li><li>Hydrophobic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intraocular Lens (IOLs) can be classified into different types based on their flexibility and material composition. Non-foldable lenses are rigid and require a larger incision during surgery. Foldable Intraocular Lens, on the other hand, can be folded for insertion through a smaller incision, leading to faster recovery times. Hydrophilic IOLs attract water molecules, providing stability and reducing the risk of glare. Hydrophobic IOLs repel water, preventing clouding and maintaining clear vision. Each type offers unique benefits for patients undergoing cataract surgery.</p></p>
