<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) Screening Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transent Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions</li><li>Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) screening systems are categorized into two main types: Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAE) and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE). TEOAE involves the measurement of sound waves generated in the inner ear in response to brief clicks or tones, helping to assess hearing function, particularly in newborns. Meanwhile, DPOAE assesses the ear's response to two simultaneous tones, providing detailed information on cochlear health and sensitivity. Both methods are crucial for early detection of hearing impairments.</p></p>
